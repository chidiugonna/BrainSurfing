                <h1 id="practicum-81-surface-based-data-formats">Practicum 8.1 -  Surface-Based Data Formats</h1>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Surface-based data formats represent neuroimaging data in two main forms namely <em>meshes</em> and <em>overlays</em>. In both cases anatomical locations are represented by <em>vertices</em> which are arbitrary points in 3D space.</p>
<p>Surface <em>meshes</em> store 2 main types of information - the Cartesian location (x, y, z) of each vertex in 3D space and the triple of vertex indices that make up a triangular face on the mesh.   </p>
<p>Surface <em>overlays</em> store attributes for each vertex. These attributes could be single value scalars like the cortical thickness at a vertex or a series of values like a time series  from an fMRI or EEG experiment.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>This practicum will introduce you to working with surface-based data (meshes and overlays) using the GIFTI and CIFTI file formats. By the end of this practicum you should</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to access the metadata of GIFTI and CIFTI files to determine the properties of the surface under study</li>
<li>Be able to directly access the image data in a GIFTI and CIFTI file and work with it</li>
<li>Be able to change the data in a GIFTI and CIFTI file and create a new file with your changes</li>
<li>Visualize your GIFTI and CIFTI files using the workbench tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Some of the tasks you will accomplish with this practicum will not ordinarily be part of your typical neuroimaging analysis workflow. For example you will rarely if ever need to change the topology of a surface mesh. However the intention of these exercises is to cement your understanding of these formats by giving you hands-on experience with manipulating them albeit in somewhat artificial scenarios.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="downloadsinstallation">Downloads/Installation</h2>
<p>This practicum requires the following materials/folder setup for successful complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reasonably recent version of <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">matlab</a>. The practicum was tested on version R2020a (linux), R2019a (windows) and R2018b (Mac) but should hopefully work on older versions as well.</li>
<li>A copy of the HCP's <a href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench">Connectome workbench</a>. We will be using <code>wb_view</code> for viewing CIFTI and GIFTI files. The install is a zip file that you extract and the executable should be available after extraction. Depending on your platform you may need to double-click the <code>wb_view</code> icon or add it to your path to access via the command line. Copies of workbench have also been packaged up at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pFMXo5nn5oRlSNsZVpT5ZKdG6Hi5aUVw">Classhare</a> for this lesson under the <strong>Software</strong> folder which you can access if you have trouble getting to the connectome site. There are 4 zip files with names that start with <code>workbench-..</code> for different OS platforms.</li>
<li>The Matlab practicum files, Matlab libraries and data for this practicum are also all available at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pFMXo5nn5oRlSNsZVpT5ZKdG6Hi5aUVw">Classhare</a> folder under the <strong>practicum81</strong> folder in a zip file <strong>practicum81.zip</strong>. Download this zip file to your local computer and extract.</li>
<li>The practicum files can also alternatively be downloaded as a zip file from <a href="https://osf.io/hetgq/">OSF</a> in the folder <strong>08-Surface-Based-Formats</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your folder structure should look like this after extraction.</p>

<p>The Matlab libraries used in this practicum are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The HCP <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">cifti-matlab</a> library was in alpha-testing phase at the time of creating this practicum and so is liable to change in the future though hopefully not significantly. The version provided  had its last commit <code>1e0ca9fbb0f9a8105d144ec6bc0de55b84d1b528</code> on <code>Wed Sep 2 15:42:55 2020 -0500</code>. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">cifti-matlab</a> repository for announcements on when the alpha-testing is complete. In the meantime if you use this code for your own research then please appreciate that you do this at your own risk and there is a chance of errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti/">gifti</a>  library was downloaded as a zip file <code>gifti-master.zip</code>, extracted and renamed to <code>gifti-release</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28518-xml2struct">xml2struct</a> was downloaded directly from the mathworks file-exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>helper-functions</code> mostly contains custom functions written in-house to support tasks 4 and 5. The function <code>read_nifti2_hdr.m</code> is a private function from the <a href="http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/">FieldTrip toolbox</a> to help with reading NIFTI-2 files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>We will be using a subset of data from the Human Connectome Project's Young Adult (YA) <a href="https://db.humanconnectome.org/data/projects/HCP_1200">1200 Subject Release</a>. Specifically data from subject 100307. The HCP has terms of reference for using their data. To use HCP data please sign on to the <a href="https://db.humanconnectome.org">HCP website</a> and register for free. </p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-files">Miscellaneous files</h3>
<p>The documentation for this practicum has also been bundled with the practicum materials as <code>prac81.pdf</code> to mitigate against internet connectivity problems. The other four matlab files <code>task_002_giftisurf.m</code>, <code>task_003_giftioverlay.m</code>, <code>task_004_cifti.m</code> and <code>task_005_cifti.m</code> are needed to undertake the respective tasks below.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-use-wb_view-to-visualize-gifti-surfaces">Task 1: Use wb_view to visualize GIFTI surfaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>wb_view</strong> either by double-clicking the <code>wb_view</code> or <code>wb_view.exe</code>  icon in your windows manager or by entering this in the command line if you have set up your paths in the command line interface correctly.</li>
<li>When <strong>wb_view</strong> opens click the  <code>skip</code> button in the dialog to get to the main screen</li>
<li>From the top menu choose <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Open File</code> and change the dropdown on <code>Files of type:</code> to <code>Surface Files (*.surf.gii)</code></li>
<li>Now navigate to <code>practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code></li>
<li>You will be presented with a host of files</li>
<li>with the left mouse button click on <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code></li>
<li>Now pressing the CTRL key (Command key on Mac) again click with the left mouse button on <code>100307.R.pial.native.surf.gii</code> to select both surfaces. You should see that both files are reflected in the <code>File name</code> textbox. The <strong>pial</strong> that these surfaces refer to is the surface boundary between grey matter and CSF in the outer cortex.</li>
<li>Now click <code>Open</code>, you should see the left and right pial surfaces displayed with lateral and medial views</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task1_selectsurfs.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the top of the application change from <strong>(1) Montage</strong> to  <strong>(2) All</strong> by clicking on the tab. You should see the left and right pial surfaces aligned on the screen. Use your mouse left button to rotate the brain around and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can get a quick overview of these surfaces by choosing <code>Surface</code> &gt; <code>Information</code>. We can see that there are 130879 vertices and 261754 faces in the left hemisphere pial surface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task1_information.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For the rest of this  exercise we just want to work with left hemisphere so we will uncheck the display for the right cortex in the <strong>(2) All</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="uncheck right hemi" src="../../img/task1_justleft.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switch on edge view by clicking the <code>Surface</code> menu option. Choose  <code>Properties</code>  and change the <code>Drawing Type</code> to <code>Links (Edges)</code>. Zoom in a little closer to see the triangular tesselation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify any vertex you like and click on it. For this example I have stumbled upon vertex <code>119115</code> which I have decided to probe. A dialog with title <strong>Information</strong> should pop up with vertex information. This dialog provides information about the vertex's hemisphere, label and its anatomical location in 3D Cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates. Notice also that the white vertex symbol icon is much larger than the width of the edges. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select vertex first" src="../../img/task1_firstselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose <code>Properties</code> in the <strong>information</strong> dialog (<code>Properties</code> is under <code>Contra ID</code> in the dialog) and change the <code>Symbol Diameter</code> and <code>Most Recent ID Symbol Diameter</code> to a suitable size. We chose <code>0.5mm</code> for our example. You can also change the <code>ID Symbol Color</code> to another value.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select vertex small icon" src="../../img/task1_secondselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once you have selected a vertex we can now try and identify its neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first pass through this practicum you should avoid choosing a vertex on the medial layer as this will cause difficulties in task 4.  To be super safe then just replicate the vertex we have chosen or choose a vertex that is easilly accessible on the lateral surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The medial layer contains vertices that are not actually on the cortical surface (actually these medial-layer vertices cut through subcortical grey matter structures and the Corpus callosum) but are required to maintain the spherical topology of the surface.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="medial layer" src="../../img/task1_mediallayer.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select all the neighbouring vertices (all vertices connected by an edge to your chosen vertex). These should show up in the information screen. You can select and copy the text from this screen and place it in a text file. We will need this information for the next Task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can leave wb_view open but minimized and proceed to the next task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="selected vertices ub wb_view" src="../../img/task1_allselected.png" /></p>
<h2 id="task-2-use-matlab-to-manipulate-gifti-surfaces">Task 2: Use Matlab to manipulate GIFTI Surfaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this task we will be loading in the GIFTI surface <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> which we visualized above and identifying the vertex and vertex neighbours we chose. We will then change the local topology of the surface by nudging these vertices by a random 3D translation and then save a new copy of the surface which we will visualize again using <strong>wb_view</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Matlab and navigate to your the  <code>practicum81</code>  folder containing <code>task_002_giftisurf.m</code>. Double click this file to open it in Matlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will run individual sections of the Matlab code by right-clicking on each section (highlighted yellow when selected) and selecting <code>Evaluate Current Section</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the 1st section and choose <code>Evaluate Current Selection</code> to run. This will ensure that Matlab can find the gifti-release library which we need to open and save GIFTI files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Add matlab library" src="../../img/task2_01_matlab_addlib.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you haven't set the right path to the gifti-release library then you will see an error like this:</p>
<pre><code>Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a directory /home/chidi/Downloads/    Practicum81/../matlab-library/gifti-release
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now right-click and run Section <strong>A</strong>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Run Section A" src="../../img/task2_02_matlab_loadgifti.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the variable <code>mysurf</code> is not pointing to the correct location for the data then you will get an error similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>Reading Surface ../DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii
Error using xml_parser
Cannot read XML document
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section will plot  a 3D model of the surface which can be rotated with the mouse. This is just to demonstrate that you can visualize your surface mesh within Matlab as well. You can close these windows whenever you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="gifti plot 3D" src="../../img/task2_03_giftiplot.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>you should also see that the expected number of faces and vertices are also printed to the screen. This information has been obtained using the <code>gifti-release</code> libraries <code>gifti()</code> function. The information is stored in the structure <code>mysurfleft_mesh</code><pre><code> mysurfleft_mesh =

   struct with fields:

        faces: [261754×3 int32]
        mat: [4×4 double]
    vertices: [130879×3 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>One source of potential confusion is that the <strong>gifti Matlab</strong> library indexes vertices starting from 1 but <strong>wb_view</strong> and the GIFTI specification start indexing from 0. </p>
<p>So the 1st vertex has an index of 0 in <strong>wb_view</strong> but has an index value of 1 in <strong>Matlab</strong>.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>faces</code> matrix contains the 3 vertex indices that are joined together to form a face on each row. In Matlab we can view the first 4 faces as follows:</p>
<pre><code>mysurfleft_mesh.faces(1:4,:)

    1    2    3
    4    3    2
    1   56    2
    57   2    56
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>We see that the first face (row 1 above) comprises vertices 1,2 and 3 which are joined together by edges. Perhaps surprisingly we see that 56 and 57 are also joined to 2 to form the fourth face. This reinforces the fact that the vertex index is just a label and does not predict spatial proximity. Remember that this uses Matlab's indexing conventions. So wb_view would specify the first face as consisting of vertices 0,1 and 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vertices matrix provides the anatomical location of each vertex. Looking at the first 4 vertices, we see that vertex 3 (i.e. vertex 2 in wb_view convention) has a location of -13.3332 mm, -106.5394 mm, -5.5976 mm</p>
<pre><code>mysurfleft_mesh.vertices(1:4,:)

  -13.0844 -106.5673   -5.1778
  -13.5373 -106.6587   -5.1817
  -13.3332 -106.5394   -5.5976
  -13.7358 -106.5008   -5.7497
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now run the next section <strong>B</strong> to find the neighbours of the vertex you located in task 1 above. Remember to change the vertex on line 25 <code>ciftivind=</code> to point to your vertex. If all goes well then you should see the same vertices you observed in <strong>wb_view</strong>. As already mentioned  <strong>wb_view</strong> (and the GIFTI XML) start indexing vertices from 0 while the <strong>gifti matlab library</strong> starts indexing from 1. So we need to add 1 to the index we obtained from <strong>wb_view</strong> to create the correct index for use in Matlab. This is already accomplished for you  in the code on line 29 by   <code>matlabvind=ciftivind + 1;</code> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="find neighbour vertices" src="../../img/task2_findvertices.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The code looks at all the columns of the faces matrix and picks out the lines that include our vertex and then does a union to create a set of vertices without duplication. The faces matrix contains a row for every triangular face. So below for example, the vertices 119116, 119106 and 119115 are connected as a face.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find 119116 in column 1:</p>
<pre><code>       119116   119106   119115
       119116   119128   119129
       119116   119129   119117

<ul>
<li>Now we will run section <strong>C</strong> to perturb each neighbouring vertex by a random number between 2 and -2 mm.</li>
<li><strong> Note: </strong> <em>This scenario will rarely happen in real-world analysis but has been designed to give you insight into the internal workings of surface-based formats. Packages like FreeSurfer do allow you to manually manipulate surfaces to correct for errors in initial modelling and this exercise demonstrates how this would work in principle.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="perturb vertices" src="../../img/task2_nudge.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This code goes through a loop and for each vertex obtains the x, y and z anatomical location information and perturbs it by a random number. We then create a new GIFTI file called <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> in your current folder which contains the changed vertex locations in a new surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we will return to <strong>wb_view</strong> to view your new GIFTI file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your amended GIFTI surface <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> that was created in the <code>Practicum81</code> folder in wb_view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> that was obtained from the folder <code>Practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code> should already be loaded into wb_view if it was not closed previously. If not then open this GIFTI file as well. We will be comparing both of them in wb_view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default there are two tabs provided when you first open wb_view these are <strong>(1) Montage</strong> and <strong>(2) All</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can click on any of the tabs and change the View to <strong>Surface</strong> by clicking the corresponding radio button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's also possible to create a new tab and change the view to <strong>Surface</strong> there.
<img alt="new tab" src="../../img/task2_newtab.png" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Choose Amended Left Hemisphere" src="../../img/task2_choosesurface_RB.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that under  <code>Brain Structure and Surface</code> that the first drop down box is set as <code>All</code> or as <code>CortexLeft</code> and that the second drop down is set to our <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> as the selected surface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let's locate our original vertex from task 1. The sequence of steps to take will depend on the state your GUI is in based on subsequent actions. The steps below should hopefully get you there regardless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <code>Window</code> and then <code>identify</code>and click on the <code>identify Surface Vertex</code> and enter the vertex Index. For our example we used <code>119115</code>. If you have several vertices displayed which are confusing you can clear all vertices by clicking on <code>RID</code> button on the <strong>Information Properties</strong> dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After clicking <code>apply</code> it might also help to change the size and color of the vertex symbol to a larger value and/or more vivid color respectively if you haven't already done so previously. You may also have to zoom out and/or rotate the brain if you chose a vertex hidden from the lateral view. You should be able to spot your vertex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="locate vertex again" src="../../img/task2_locatevertex.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now Change the Surface properties to <code>Link(Edges)</code> (if not already changed from previous steps) and zoom in closer to see how the pertubations you made to the neighboring vertices have changed the topology. You will probably need to change the symbol diameter to something smaller. You should notice that the topology of your vertices has changed. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="surface is amended" src="../../img/task2_amendedsurface.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can contrast this with the original by clicking back and forth  on the dropdown in the tab (under <code>Brain Structure and Surface</code>) switching between the original surface and your amended surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="compare" src="../../img/task2_leftpialoriginalview.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also click on a Montage view to see both surfaces side by side (You will need to deselect either the medial or lateral checkbox to see the vertex and neighbours properly side by side). You will also need to select both surfaces as different layers in the montage selection. You should confirm that you have successfully change the topology of your surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="compare in montage" src="../../img/task2_montagecompare.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We won't dwell too long on the next two sections but these sections give you more insight into the XML structure of the GIFTI structure so that you can compare that with the data provided by the <strong>gifti matlab</strong> library. Essentially this library just reads this XML in the GIFTI to create the <code>faces</code> and <code>vertices</code> structures that you have just looked at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will return to the Matlab file to run <strong>section D</strong>  to view the GIFTI metadata in a browser to see exactly how the XML is used to represent the GIFTI format. All this section does is re-save the GIFTI in ASCII format as <code>mygifti_allxml.gii</code> so that most text editors can view it conveniently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After running section D, you can now simply open the created <code>mygifti_allxml.gii</code> file directly in your browser or by using <code>VScode</code> if it does not open automatically in firefox. (you may get an error on windows that states <code>'firefox is not recognized..'</code> - this can be completely ignored and the command console that opens with this message can be closed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some browsers like Chrome may require you to explicitly rename this as an xml file <code>mygifti_allxml.xml</code> in order to view the XML with helpful highlighting and the ability to collapse and expand sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can collapse and expand XML sections in the browser by clicking on the -/+ signs respectively. Notice that the vertex anatomical location information is represented as a <strong>DataArray</strong> with an <strong>Intent</strong> name of <code>NIFTI_INTENT_POINTSET</code>. The number of vertices is captured by <strong>Dim0="130879"</strong>. The triangular faces are represented in the second data array as <code>NIFTI_INTENT_TRIANGLE</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Run Section D" src="../../img/task2_optionalD.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the <strong>Data</strong> tag in the <code>NIFTI_INTENT_POINTSET</code> dataarray and then look at the surface mesh vertex information that is loaded in by the gifti library. Notice how the columns are loaded in first before the rows. This is known as Column Major Order and is specified also in the XML as a DataArray attribute as <code>&lt;DataArray ArrayIndexingOrder="ColumnMajorOrder"..</code>  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="GIFTI XML" src="../../img/task2_optionalD_col.png" />
<img alt="Column Major Order" src="../../img/task2_optionalD_colmat.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notice also that for the faces defined as <code>NIFTI_INTENT_TRIANGLE</code> in the second DataArray that the vertices are indexed starting from zero and are also stored using Column Major Order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Section E</strong> accomplishes the same as Section D except that now the xml data is loaded into a Matlab structure. You can skip this section as all it does is corroborate what you have already seen above. It is divided into 2 parts, <strong>E1</strong> and <strong>E2</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Section <strong>E1</strong> to fix the xml in the GIFTI. We need to do this as unfortunately there is a slight problem reading the XML file into Matlab as the 2nd line which starts <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE</code> causes problems with the parser. The line <code>sed 2d...</code> in the Matlab file is written to delete this line on unix and save a new text file called <code>mygifti_xml.gii</code> which is then parsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In windows you will get an error that states <code>'sed is not recognized..'</code> - this can be completely ignored and the command console that opens with this message can be closed). You will need to  use <code>powershell</code> instead if its available or alternatively manually open the xml file in a text processor and delete the 2nd line. In Matlab you can invoke a powershell shell as follows:</p>
<pre><code>!powershell
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After powershell loads enter the command below to remove the 2nd line:</p>
<pre><code>    Get-Content mygifti_allxml.gii  | Where {$_ -notmatch 'DOCTYPE'} | Set-Content mygifti_xml.gii
</code></pre>
<p>Then return to Matlab by typing <code>exit</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now run <strong>Section E2</strong> to load the XML into a Matlab structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now identify the same XML structures as we saw above in the browser. For example <code>myXML.GIFTI.DataArray{2}.Data</code> gives us the <strong>faces</strong> information for the surface:</p>
<pre><code>myXML.GIFTI.DataArray{2}.Data
    =
Text: '0 3 0 56 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 72 3 3 4 4 6 14 6 6 6 11
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-3-use-matlab-to-manipulate-and-visualize-gifti-overlays">Task 3: Use Matlab to manipulate and visualize GIFTI overlays</h2>
<p>We have been able to work with and manipulate <strong>GIFTI surface files</strong>. In this task we will now look at an example of a <strong>GIFTI overlay</strong> that maps cortical thickness  values onto the pial vertices and we will attempt to manipulate and visualize this overlay.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>wb_view</strong> is already open from previous tasks then you can use the <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Save/Manage Files</code> functionality to selectively close files. Select to close the Right Pial and the amended Left pial. We will be using the original Left pial in this task.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="selective close" src="../../img/task2_closeselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively if you want to start from scratch then just choose <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Close all files</code> </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="close all" src="../../img/task4_closefiles.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>in <strong>wb_view</strong> load in the surface <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> again from <code>Practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code> if not already open. Click on <strong>Surface</strong> to view the Left hemisphere. Now load in the cortical thickness overlay <code>100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> from the same location. You will need to change the <code>Files of type</code> field to  <code>Metric Files (*.func.gii *.shape.gii)</code> or <code>Any File (*)</code> to be able to select the thickness overlay. Activate the layer by clicking on the checkbox alongside it. Also click on the color bar to see the range of cortical thicknesses across the brain and their associated colors.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="load overlay" src="../../img/task3_loadOverlay.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now locate the vertices you looked at previously (using <code>Window</code> &gt; <code>identify</code>) and find their cortical thicknesses by looking at the information dialog. Notice that for our central vertex (119115 in this case)  we have a cortical thickness of 3.54125 mm.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="view thickness" src="../../img/task3_viewThickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will now open this overlay in Matlab, change the cortical thickness of our target vertex and its neighbors and visualize the changed overlay in wb_view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the file <code>task_003_giftioverlay.m</code> in matlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As before run each section in Matlab separately to follow along with what is happening in the code. First run the <code>addpath ..</code> section to ensure that the gifti library is accessible and that all Matlab windows are closed and variables cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In  section <strong>A</strong> we load in the surface as before and now also load in the cortical thickness overlay. Notice that the overlay and the surface match as the number of vertices is equal to the number of thickness values.</p>
<pre><code>Reading Surface ./DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overlay has all its thickness values for each vertex stored in a <code>cdata</code> matrix:</p>
<pre><code>myoverlayleft =

  struct with fields:

    cdata: [130879×1 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the gifti library's overloaded <code>plot</code> command we also visualize the surface in one window and also observe overlay plotted on the surface in another window with a color scale used to designate varying thickness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="plot overlay on mesh" src="../../img/task3_overlaymesh.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Section B</strong> we see a print out of the cortical thickness values at our neighbouring vertices which should match the values we identifed in <strong>wb_view</strong>. In <strong>Section C</strong> we set the thicknesses of our <strong>chosen vertex and its neighbors</strong> to a uniform value of 2mm and then save a copy called 
<code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to wb_view and open the <code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> overlay. Compare this with the original  <code>100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> overlay and confirm that all the vertices now have a thickness value of 2mm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="change thickness" src="../../img/task3_changeThickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can change what overlays are activated and the precedence in which they are displayed by selecting different files and/or toggling the visibility of the layer. You may also want to change the <code>Drawing Type</code> in <code>Surface</code> &gt; <code>Properties</code> to <code>Triangles</code> to see a clear thickness change in the patch of cortex as you toggle between layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="layer preference" src="../../img/task3_layerprec.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition you may also want to view the amended cortical thickness overlay <code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> on your amended pial surface <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> or on other surfaces that are available in the same directory. These surfaces are all in vertex correspondence for the subject 100307.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section D and E you can again study the XML structure of the overlay as you did in task 2 above to see how it corresponds to the gifti structure loaded into Matlab.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-4-use-matlab-to-manipulate-and-visualize-cifti-files">Task 4: Use Matlab to manipulate and visualize CIFTI files</h2>
<p>So far we have learned to work with GIFTI files. In this penultimate task we are going to work with CIFTI files which combine both volume data for subcortical structures and surface data for cortical structures into one file. Unfortunately the HCP's Matlab library was still in <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">Alpha testing</a> at the time of creating this practicum and so we need to be aware that there is a slight chance that the coding conventions used here may change however the overal conceptual approach should remain the same.</p>
<p>We will work with HCP data again and this time with CIFTI cortical thickness data <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> from the left and right cortex. </p>
<p>To visualize CIFTI data in <strong>wb_view</strong> we need a GIFTI surface file that is associated with the CIFTI data. Close all loaded surfaces and overlays if <strong>wb_view</strong> is already open.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>wb_view</strong> and load in GIFTI surface <code>100307.L.midthickness.native.surf.gii</code> - this surface is midway between the <code>pial</code> surface we used previously and the <code>white</code> surface. Now load in the midthickness surface for the right hemisphere <code>100307.R.midthickness.native.surf.gii</code>. Click on <strong>All</strong> view to see both hemispheres aligned in the view. You can rotate the whole brain to a perspective that works for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="aligned surface" src="../../img/task4_alignedsurface.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now open <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> - you will need to specify <strong>Files of type: (*.dscalar.nii)</strong> to be able to select this file. Activate the layer by clicking on the checkbox and notice that this CIFTI file has cortical thickness information for both hemispheres. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_ciftithickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lets return to Matlab and open the Matlab file <code>task004_cifti.m</code> and execute the prelim section to load in the Matlab libraries that we need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Section A</strong> we will briefly explore the overlay <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> as a NIFTI-2 file. We will use a private function  <code>read_nifti2_hdr.m</code> which is packaged as part of the <code>FieldTrip</code> Matlab library. The diagram below shows how a NIFTI-2 file is used to package up this CIFTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cifti in nifti2" src="../../img/Cifti_format.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can confirm that the size of the CIFTI file in bytes is equal to the size of the voxel offset field plus the data size in bytes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; filesize = 
     2525056

&gt;&gt; nii2.vox_offset
   1531104

&gt;&gt; nii2.dim
   6   1  1  1  1  1  248488  1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>where the value of <code>nii2.dim[7] = 248488</code> is the data size in floats which is equal to <code>4*248488=993952</code> in bytes. The XML is thus embedded in the extent section between the header and the data. It is this section that the cifti-matlab library reads to determine exactly how the surface and volume models are set up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">

<ul>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>Section B</strong> to explore the CIFTI XML file in a Matlab structure and in a browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that like the gifti overlay this cifti overlay has data for both cortices in a <code>cdata</code> structure which can be accessed as <code>ciiall.cdata</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ciiall

ciiall =

  struct with fields:

    metadata: [1×3 struct]
     diminfo: {[1×1 struct]  [1×1 struct]}
       cdata: [248488×1 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The xml data has also been stored in a CIFTI structure</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ciixml

ciixml =

  struct with fields:

    CIFTI: [1×1 struct]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information stored in the above two structures matches the XML data that can be visualized in the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code has been set up to open the CIFTI XML automatically in firefox if it is installed in your path but this may not work on your system without some tweaking. You can also simply view the XML directly in a browser or in VScode by opening the file <code>debug.xml</code> that is created in your current folder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that the first dimension is <code>CIFTI_INDEX_TYPE_SCALARS</code> which means that each vertex/voxel has a single scalar value which in this file is the cortical thickness. Also notice that the second dimension is <code>CIFTI_INDEX_TYPE_BRAIN_MODELS</code> which is used to map every voxel/vertex in a cortical or subcortical structure. Just the  left cortex <code>CIFTI_STRUCTURE_CORTEX_LEFT</code> and the right cortex <code>CIFTI_STRUCTURE_CORTEX_RIGHT</code> are represented in this file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="xml scalar view" src="../../img/task4_ciftixmlscalar.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information for each cortex can be obtained by looking at the <code>diminfo</code> fields. Here we look at the model for the CORTEX_LEFT which is contained in <code>diminfo{1}.models{1}</code></p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{1}

 ans =

   struct with fields:

        start: 1
        count: 125197
       struct: 'CORTEX_LEFT'
         type: 'surf'
      numvert: 130879
     vertlist: [1×125197 double]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike the GIFTI Matlab library that indexed vertices starting from 1, this CIFTI library uses an index to index the vertices! This is a little complicated but in essence if we look at the <code>vertlist</code> structure for the first three vertices in the left hemisphere we see that they are correctly identified as 0,1 and 2.</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{1}.vertlist(1:3)
ans =

     0     1     2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>As already mentioned, the data structure <code>ciiall</code> contains all the cortical thickness data for both hemispheres in <code>ciiall.cdata</code> indexed starting from 1 to 125197 for the left cortex and from 125198 to 248488. These indexes are used as pointers into a vertex list <code>vertlist</code> which is stored for each surface. So the cortical thickness values for the first three vertices 0,1,2 in the Left hemisphere are obtained as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.cdata(1:3)

ans =

  3×1 single column vector

        2.201649
        2.323979
         2.41378
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>There however appears to be an inconsistency with the total number of vertices allocated to the overlay. In the last task we had 130879 vertices in the left hemisphere but here we have 125197 vertices assigned (roughly about 5600 vertices fewer). What's going on? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essentially the HCP CIFTI files do not store data for the medial layer of each cortex. We saw the medial layer in the first task. We will identify these medial vertices and visualize a few of them on the left cortex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>section C</strong> to print out all the vertices that are missing from the left cortex. These are the medial vertices. There should be <code>5682</code> vertices in the medial layer displayed to screen. Select one or a few of them and using the <code>identify</code> tool in <code>wb_view</code> try to see where they are. You will need to use the surface view and visualize the left cortex only so you can see these vertices. Some of these are easier to spot than others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="medial vertices" src="../../img/task4_mediallayer.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>section D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> we do what we did in task 3 and will now go ahead and change the value of a vertex and its neighbors to a constant value of 2mm cortical thickness. The code uses a vertex value of 119115 but of course you should use any vertex you like except for the medial vertices which the CIFTI file does not track. Open the <code>amended.100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> that is created in your current directory in wb_view and navigate to the vertex to confirm that changes have been made.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Rotate the brain to get a better view of the fMRI data. Notice that there are values in both the cortex (surface-based data represented by vertices) and in the subcortex (volume-based data represented by voxels).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cifti fmri" src="../../img/task4_ciftifmri.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To navigate the volume-based data more conveniently you can click on the <strong>Volume</strong> view to access the traditional volume viewing interface. In <strong>Slice Plane</strong> pane (not the View Pane!) you can select <strong>All</strong> to view Axial, Parasagittal and Coronal planes at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again you will need to switch on the overlay and choose <code>rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> over the <code>dynconn...</code> overlay. You can move through volume slices by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. You can zoom in by using the mouse scroll wheel. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cifti volume" src="../../img/task4_ciftivolume.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>To help with spatial awareness you can load in a NIFTI-1 T1w volume. Open <code>T1w_restore_brain.nii.gz</code> which is available at <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear</code>. Activate the overlay so that it is visible.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="T1w overlay" src="../../img/task5_volume.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In both the voxel and surface view,  individual fmri instances at each TR can be stepped through by clicking on the index arrows. You can also navigate to a specific timepoint in the series by clicking on the <strong>map</strong> drop down and selecting the time instance of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="move volumes" src="../../img/task4_changetime.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One nice application within <code>wb_view</code> is the ability to interactively view functional connectivity. To see this in action Let us activate the <strong>All</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can then load in Freesurfer's Destrieux atlas which has been converted to gifti format. The left and right hemisphere atlases are called <code>100307.L.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code> and <code>100307.R.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code> and are available here <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/fsaverage_LR32k/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activate  all three overlays in the <strong>All</strong> view and from top to bottom select the <code>Dynconn - rfMRI..</code> layer, then the Left and Right atlas label files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now click on any brain area and you will see the functional connectivity of every other vertex to that vertex which has been calculated dynamically. If you spin the cortex around you will also see that the connectivity is also calculated for voxels as well. The areas which are functionally connected are displayed with colors that represent higher correlation. So in the example below all the yellow areas are functionally connected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="dynamic connectivity" src="../../img/task4_dynconn.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For the above we used a different color map which is accessible from the little wrench symbol. You can also view the scale used for the color bar by clicking the multi-colored bar.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="color bar" src="../../img/task5_colorbar.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="change colors" src="../../img/task4_changecolors.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Back to Matlab now so we can explore a little more how this CIFTI file stores both volumes and surfaces in the same NIFTI-2 file. Open <code>task_005_cifti.m</code> and run the first section as usual to clear the workspace and add the necessary libraries to our path. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Section <strong>A</strong> to see how the CIFTI XML has different sections for surfaces and for voxels. Note that each volume structure has an individual label e.g CIFTI_STRUCTURE_ACCUMBENS_LEFT. As you did in <strong>Task 4</strong> you can query the XML directly in the structure <code>ciixml</code> and also compare this with the data that has been stored in the data structure <code>ciiall</code> by the HCP Matlab library. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output that is displayed in the command window is obtained by going through the XML file. It shows that information about voxels and vertices are stored at the same time in the XML file and that the actual overlay data for each vertex and voxel is indexed sequentially in the NIFTI-2 file. So for example with our CIFTI file if we read off a value at row position 59695 in the data array then this will be a value in AMYGDALA_LEFT (between 59688 and 60002)</p>
<pre><code>...
Model 1 is a surface of CORTEX_LEFT with  29696  verts valued out of 32492 vertices; start from 1 and end at 29696
Model 2 is a surface of CORTEX_RIGHT with  29716  verts valued out of 32492  vertices; start from 29697 and end at 59412
Model 3 is a volume of ACCUMBENS_LEFT with  135 voxels; start from 59413 and end at 59547
Model 4 is a volume of ACCUMBENS_RIGHT with  140 voxels; start from 59548 and end at 59687
Model 5 is a volume of AMYGDALA_LEFT with  315 voxels; start from 59688 and end at  60002
Model 6 is a volume of AMYGDALA_RIGHT with  332 voxels; start from 60003 and end at  60334
...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code has been set up to open the CIFTI XML automatically in firefox if it is installed in your path but this may not work on your system without some tweaking. You can also simply view the XML directly in a browser or in VScode by opening the file <code>debug.xml</code> that is created in your current folder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>B</strong>, we will now take an arbitrary vertex 17617 in the <strong>Right</strong> hemisphere and plot the fmri data in that vertex along with its closest neighbors. Observe that we have to check for existence of the neighbors that we find in the available list of vertices because one of the neighbors might actually be in the medial layer. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is achieved for you using the code <code>neighindex=ismember(visverts,allverts);</code>  which takes <code>allverts</code> which includes vertex 17617 as well as its close neighbours and compares it against all the visible vertices that are not on the medial layer.</p>
<p>Notice also how we have to pinpoint the Right Hemisphere vertex data within <code>ciiall.cdata</code> data by using an offset because the <code>ciiall.cdata</code> is populated first with values from the left cortex but the Right Hemisphere starts indexing its vertices from 0. This is achieved already for you using the code <code>findRHneighbors=findneighbors + ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{2}.start - 1</code> to identify the vertices and then <code>plot(ciiall.cdata(findRHneighbors,:)')</code> to display their fMRI series.</p>
<p><img alt="fmri plot" src="../../img/task4_timeseries.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>C</strong>, we do the same for another arbitrary point on the Right cortex, vertex 8470 and we see a plot of the time series for this vertex and its neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>D</strong>, we now switch gears and look at a volume. We will investigate the Left Hippocampus which is indexed as model number 14 in the array of available models. Volumes are indexed using a voxel list <code>voxlist</code> which is part of the struct <code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{14}.voxlist</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{14} =

  struct with fields:

      start: 84561
      count: 764
     struct: 'HIPPOCAMPUS_LEFT'
       type: 'vox'
    voxlist: [3×764 double]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voxel list is actually a 2D matrix with 3 rows representing the <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong> and <strong>k</strong> index coordinates in the x, y and z directions.</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{14}.voxlist(:,1:3)'

ans =

    55    60    21
    56    60    21
    57    60    21
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now use an arbitrary voxel 56,56,25 within the Left Hippocampus and identify its potential neighbors. We allow diagonal voxel elements to be classified as neighbors and so a voxel can have potentially 26 close neighbors. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again as with the vertices we check the <code>voxlist</code> for existence as some of these voxels might be in other structures and thus not accessible within the Left Hippocampus. We do find that there are 26 neighbors to our voxel. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Section <strong>E</strong> we simulate an fMRI signal and place identical copies of it in vertex 17617 and its 6 neighbors, vertex 8470 and its 6 neighbours and voxel 56,56,25 and its 26 neighbors. And finally in section <strong>F</strong> we save a copy of this  in a new CIFTI file called <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let's return to <strong>wb_view</strong>. It might be easier to close all files and then load in the following files:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/fsaverage_LR32k/</code> load in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>100307.R.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code> ,</li>
<li><code>100307.L.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code>, and</li>
<li><code>100307.R.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.dlabel.nii</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/</code> load in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> and </li>
<li><code>T1w_restore_brain.nii.gz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally we can now load in the amended fMRI from the current directory <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Volume</strong> view and activate the <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> layer. Deselect the T1w_restore_brain.nii.gz layer and any other layer that may be activated in the Volume view. This ensures that the coodinate system of the <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> layer, takes precedence in the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Slice Indices/Coords</strong> section enter in the voxel coordinates of the left hippocampal voxel <code>56,56,25</code> in the first column. The cross-hairs should center on that voxel. Zoom in to the voxel by using the mouse scroll wheel. The image below shows an Axial volume view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="left hippo voxels" src="../../img/task4_hippovox1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now activate the <code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> layer and click on the crosshairs to confirm voxel <code>56,56,25</code> is in the Left Hippocampus. Also notice that the voxels around it have the same value as we would expect. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="check hippo" src="../../img/task4_hippovox2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivate the <code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> layer and now change the <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> layer. to <code>dynconn - amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dynconn</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="dynconn layer" src="../../img/task4_hippodyncon.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now change the view to <strong>All</strong>, deactivate the Left cortex to make the left hippocampus more visisble. Activate the right cortex and rotate the brain to view the Right hemisphere  and also activate the <code>dynconn - amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dynconn</code> layer. You should be able to identify that the vertices 8470 and 17617 are functionally connected to the hippocampus. This is what we expect as we placed identical fmri values in all these three regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="full dyn conn" src="../../img/task4_surfdynconn.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to experiment with different color palette settings and/or views to get a more dramatic effect. Shown below is the <code>magma</code> color palette with a range defined from <code>0.2</code> to <code>-0.2</code> used in the <strong>All</strong> view with the voxel settings set at <code>56,56,25</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="magma" src="../../img/task4_colorpalette.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the right hemisphere outside of vertices 8470 or 17617 will reduce the functional connectivity of the hippocampal voxels. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="magma connectivity off" src="../../img/task4_nosurfdynconn_magma.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>And clicking on those vertices will re-establish the functional connectivity with the hippocampus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="magma connectivity on" src="../../img/task4_surfdynconn_magma.png" /></p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>This concludes this introduction to the GIFTI and CIFTI formats. This practicum has used Matlab libraries to query, read and write Surface-Based formats however there are other approaches like the Python-based NiBabel library which provides functions for working with <a href="https://nipy.org/nibabel/reference/nibabel.cifti2.html">Cifti</a> and <a href="https://nipy.org/nibabel/reference/nibabel.gifti.html">Gifti</a> files. </p>
