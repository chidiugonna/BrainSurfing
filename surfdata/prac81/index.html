                <h1 id="practicum-81-surface-based-data-formats">Practicum 8.1 -  Surface-Based Data Formats</h1>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Surface-based data formats represent neuroimaging data in two main forms namely <em>meshes</em> and <em>overlays</em>. In both cases anatomical locations are represented by <em>vertices</em> which are arbitrary points in 3D space.</p>
<p>Surface <em>meshes</em> store 2 main types of information - the cartesian location (x, y, z) of each vertex in 3D space and the triplet of vertex indices that make up a triangular face on the mesh.   </p>
<p>Surface <em>overlays</em> store attributes for each vertex. These attributes could be single value scalars like the cortical thickness at a vertex or a series of values like a time series  from an fMRI or EEG experiment.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>This practicum will introduce you to working with surface-based data using the GIFTI and CIFTI file formats. By the end of this practicum you should</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to access the metadata of GIFTI and CIFTI files to determine the properties of the surface under study</li>
<li>Be able to directly access the image data in a GIFTI and CIFTI file and work with it</li>
<li>Be able to change the data in a GIFTI and CIFTI file and create a new file with your changes</li>
<li>Visualize your GIFTI and CIFTI files using the workbench tool</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downloadsinstallation">Downloads/Installation</h2>
<p>This practicum requires the following materials/folder setup to work to complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reasonably recent version of <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">matlab</a>. The practicum was tested on version R2020a (linux) and R2019a (windows)  but should work on older versions as well.</li>
<li>A copy of the HCP's <a href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench">Connectome workbench</a>. We will be using <code>wb_view</code> for viewing CIFTI and GIFTI files. The install is a zip file that you extract and the executable should be available after extraction. Depending on your platform you may need to double-click the <code>wb_view</code> icon or add it to your path to access via the command line. Copies of workbench have also been packaged up at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mMOCftWzKsa31LrVHa1PvJCEsRfmrmx2">Classhare</a> for this lesson under the <strong>Software</strong> folder which you can access if you have trouble getting to the connectome site. There are 4 zip files with names that start with <code>workbench-..</code> for different OS platforms.</li>
<li>The matlab practicum files, matlab libraries and data for this practicum are also all available at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mMOCftWzKsa31LrVHa1PvJCEsRfmrmx2">Classhare</a> folder under the <strong>practicum81</strong> folder. Download this folder to your local computer and extract. This should create a new folder called <code>practicum81-YYYYMMDD</code>. Navigate further into the folder hierarchy into <code>practicum81</code> and extract <code>DATA.zip</code> and <code>matlab-library.zip</code>the same way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your folder structure should look like this after extraction.</p>

<h3 id="matlab-libraries">Matlab libraries</h3>
<p>The matlab libraries used in this practicum are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The HCP <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">cifti-matlab</a> library is in alpha-testing phase and so is liable to change in the future though hopefully not significantly. The version provided  had it's last commit <code>1e0ca9fbb0f9a8105d144ec6bc0de55b84d1b528</code> on <code>Wed Sep 2 15:42:55 2020 -0500</code>. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">cifti-matlab</a> repository for announcements on when the alpha-testing is complete. In the meantime if you use this code for your own research then please appreciate that you do this at your won risk and there is a chance of errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti/">gifti</a>  library was downloaded as a zip file <code>gifti-master.zip</code>, extracted and renamed to <code>gifti-release</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28518-xml2struct">xml2struct</a> was downloaded directly from the mathworks fileexchange.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>We will be using a subset of data from the Human Connectome Project's Young Adult (YA) <a href="https://db.humanconnectome.org/data/projects/HCP_1200">1200 Subject Release</a>. Specifically data from subject 100307. The HCP has terms of reference for using their data. To use HCP data please sign on to the <a href="https://db.humanconnectome.org">HCP website</a> and register for free. </p>
<h2 id="task-1-use-wb_view-to-visualize-gifti-surfaces">Task 1: Use wb_view to visualize GIFTI surfaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open wb_view either by double-clicking the <code>wb_view</code> or <code>wb_view.exe</code>  icon in your windows manager or by entering this in the command line if you have set up your paths in the command line interface correctly.</li>
<li>When <strong>wb_view</strong> opens click the  <code>skip</code> button in the dialog to get to the main screen</li>
<li>From the top menu choose <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Open File</code> and change the dropdown on <code>Files of type:</code> to <code>Surface Files (*.surf.gii)</code></li>
<li>Now navigate to <code>Practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code></li>
<li>You will be presented with a host of files</li>
<li>with the left mouse button click on <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code></li>
<li>Now pressing the CTRL key (Command key on Mac) again click with the left mouse buton on <code>100307.R.pial.native.surf.gii</code> to select both surfaces. You should see that both files are reflected in the <code>File name</code> textbox. The <strong>pial</strong> that these surfaces refer to is the surface boundary between grey matter and CSF in the outer cortex.</li>
<li>Now click <code>Open</code>, you should see the left and right pial surfaces displayed with lateral and medial views</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task1_selectsurfs.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At top of the application change from <strong>(1) Montage</strong> to  <strong>(2) All</strong> by clicking on the tab. You should see the left and right pial surfaces aligned on the screen. Use your mouse left button to rotate the brain around and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can get a quick overview of these surfaces by choosing <code>Surface</code> &gt; <code>Information</code>. We can see that there are 130879 vertices and 261754 faces in the left hemisphere pial surface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task1_information.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For the rest of this  exercise we just want to work with left hemisphere so we will uncheck the display for the right cortex in the <strong>(2) All</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task1_justleft.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switch on edge view by clicking the <code>Surface</code> menu option. Choose  <code>Properties</code>  and change the <code>Drawing Type</code> to <code>Links (Edges)</code>. Zoom in a little closer to see the triangular tesselation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify any vertex you like and click on it. For this example I have stumbled upon vertex <code>119115</code> which I have decided to probe. A dialog with title <strong>Information</strong> should pop up with vertex information. Notice also that the white vertex symbol icon is much larger than the width of the edges. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select vertex first" src="../../img/task1_firstselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose <code>Properties</code> in the <strong>information</strong> dialog (<code>Properties</code> is under <code>Contra ID</code> in the dialog) and change the <code>Symbol Diameter</code> and <code>Most Recent ID Symbol Diameter</code> to a suitable size. We chose <code>0.5mm</code> for our example. You can also change the <code>ID Symbol Color</code> to another value.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select vertex small icon" src="../../img/task1_secondselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have selected a vertex we can now try and identify it's neighbors. For the first pass through this practicum you should avoid chossing a vertex on the medial layer as this will cause difficulties in task 4 which will become clear. To be super safe then just replicate the vertex we have chosen or choose a vertex that is easilly accessible on the lateral surface.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task1_mediallayer.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select all the neighbouring vertices (all vertices connected by an edge to your chosen vertex). These should show up in the information screen. You can select and copy the text from this screen and place it in a text file. We will need this information for the next Task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can leave wb_view open but minimized and proceed to the next task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task1_allselected.png" /></p>
<h2 id="task-2-use-matlab-to-manipulate-gifti-surfaces">Task 2: Use Matlab to manipulate GIFTI Surfaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this task we will be loading in the GIFTI surface <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> which we visualized above and identifying the vertex and vertex neighbours we chose. We will then change the local topology of the surface by nudging these vertices by a random 3D translation and then save a new copy of the surface which we will visualize again using <strong>wb_view</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open matlab and navigate to your the  <code>practicum81</code>  folder containing <code>task_002_giftisurf.m</code>. Double click this file to open it in matlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will run individual sections of the matlab code by right clicking on each section (highlighted yellow when selected) and selecting <code>Evaluate Current Section</code>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the 1st section and choose <code>Evaluate Current Selection</code> to run. This will ensure that matlab can find the gifti-release library which we need to open and save GIFTI files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_01_matlab_addlib.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you haven't set the right path to the gifti-release library then you will see an error like this:</p>
<pre><code>Warning: Name is nonexistent or not a directory /home/chidi/Downloads/    Practicum81/../matlab-library/gifti-release
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now write click and run Section <strong>A</strong>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_02_matlab_loadgifti.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the variable <code>mysurf</code> is not pointing to the correct location for the data then you will get an error similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>Reading Surface ../DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii
Error using xml_parser
Cannot read XML document
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section will plot  a 3D model of the surface which can be rotated with the mouse. This is just to demonstrate that you can visualize your surface mesh within matlab as well. You can close these windows whenever you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_03_giftiplot.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>you should also see that the expected number of faces and vertices are also printed to the screen. This information has been obtained using the <code>gifti-release</code> libraries <code>gifti()</code> function. The information is stored in the structure <code>mysurfleft_mesh</code><pre><code> mysurfleft_mesh =

   struct with fields:

        faces: [261754×3 int32]
        mat: [4×4 double]
    vertices: [130879×3 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>One source of potential confusion is that the <strong>gifti matlab</strong> library indexes vertices starting from 1 but <strong>wb_view</strong> and the GIFTI specification start indexing from 0. </p>
<p>So the 1st vertex has an index of 0 in <strong>wb_view</strong> but has an index value of 1 in <strong>matlab</strong>.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>faces</code> matrix contains the 3 vertex indices that are joined togeher to form a face on each row. Looking at the first 4 faces we can see that vertices 1,2 and 3 are joined together to form a face. Perhaps surprisingly we see that 56 and 57 are also joined to 2 to form a face. This reinforces the fact that the vertex index is just a label and does not predict spatial proximity. Remember that this uses matlab's indexing conventions. So wb_view would specify the first face as consisting of vertices 0,1 and 2.</p>
<pre><code>mysurfleft_mesh.faces(1:4,:)

    1    2    3
    4    3    2
    1   56    2
    57   2    56
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vertices matrix provides the anatomical location of each vertex. Looking at the first 4 vertices, we see that vertex 3 (i.e. vertex 2 in wb_convention) has a location of -13.3332 mm, -106.5394 mm, -5.5976 mm</p>
<pre><code>mysurfleft_mesh.vertices(1:4,:)

  -13.0844 -106.5673   -5.1778
  -13.5373 -106.6587   -5.1817
  -13.3332 -106.5394   -5.5976
  -13.7358 -106.5008   -5.7497
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now run the next section <strong>B</strong> to find the neighbours of the vertex you located in task 1 above. Remember to change the vertex on line 21 <code>ciftivind=</code> to point to your vertex. If all goes well then you should see the same vertices you observed in <strong>wb_view</strong>. As already mentioned  <strong>wb_view</strong> (and the GIFTI XML) start indexing vertices from 0 while the <strong>gifti matlab library</strong> starts indexing from 1. So we need to add 1 to the index we obtained from <strong>wb_view</strong> to create the correct index for use in matlab.</p>
<pre><code>matlabvind=ciftivind + 1;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_findvertices.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The code looks at all the columns of the faces matrix and picks out the lines that include our vertex and then does a union to create a set of vertices without duplication. The faces matrix contains a row for every triangular face. So below for example the vertices 119116, 119106 and 119115 are connected as a face.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find 119116 in column 1:</p>
<pre><code>       119116   119106   119115
       119116   119128   119129
       119116   119129   119117
</code></pre>
<p>Find 119116 in column 2:</p>
<pre><code>       118448   119116   119115
       119106   119116   119107
</code></pre>
<p>Find 119116 in column 3:</p>
<pre><code>       118448   118449   119116
       118449   119128   119116
       119117   119107   119116
</code></pre>
<p>Amalgamate all the vertices and  remove duplicates:</p>
<pre><code>118448 118449 119106 119107 119115 119117 119128 119129
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now we will run section <strong>C</strong> to perturb each neighbouring vertex by a random number between 2 and -2 mm. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_nudge.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This code goes through a loop and for each vertex obtains the x, y and z anatomical location information and perturbs it by a random number. We then create a new GIFTI file called <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> in your current folder which contains the changed vertex locations in a new surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we will return to <strong>wb_view</strong> to view your new GIFTI file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your amended GIFTI surface <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> that was created in the <code>Practicum81</code> folder in wb_view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> that was obtained from the folder <code>Practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code> should already be loaded into wb_view if it was not closed previously. If not then open this GIFTI file as well. We will be comparing both of them in wb_view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default there are two tabs provided when you first open wb_view these are <strong>(1) Montage</strong> and <strong>(2) All</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can click on any of the tabs and change the View to <strong>Surface</strong> by clicking the corresponding radio button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's also possible to create a new tab and change the view to <strong>Surface</strong> there.
<img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_newtab.png" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_choosesurface_RB.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that under  <code>Brain Structure and Surface</code> that the first drop down box is set as <code>All</code> or as <code>CortexLeft</code> and that the second drop down is set to our <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> as the selected surface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let's locate our original vertex from task 1.  Switch on vertex view by clicking the <code>Surface</code> menu option. Choose  <code>Properties</code>  and change the <code>Drawing Type</code> to <code>Vertices</code> and press Close</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now click on <code>Window</code> and then <code>identify</code>and click on the <code>identify Surface Vertex</code> and enter the vertex Index. For our example we used <code>119115</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After clicking <code>apply</code> it should also help to change the size and color of the vertex symbol to a larger value and more vivid color respectively. In the <code>Information</code> dialog, click on properties and change the vertex color and size. You may also have to rotate the brain if you chose a vertex hidden from the lateral view. You should be able to spot your vertex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task2_locatevertex.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now Change the Surface properties to <code>Link(Edges)</code> and zoom in closer to see how the pertubations you made to the neighboring vertices have changed the topology. You will probably need to change the symbol diameter to something smaller. You should notice that the topology of your vertices has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task2_amendedsurface.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can contrast this with the original by clicking back and forth  on the dropdown in the tab (under <code>Brain Structure and Surface</code>) switching between the original surface and your amended surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task2_leftpialoriginalview.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also click on a Montage view to see both surfaces side by side (You will need to deselect either the medial or lateral checkbox to see the vertex and neighbours properly side by side). You should confirm that you have successfully change the topology of your surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task2_montagecompare.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We won't dwell too long on the next two sections but these sections give you more insight into the XML structure of the GIFTI structure so that you can compare that with the data provided by the <strong>gifti matlab</strong> library. Essentially this library just reads this XML in the GIFTI to create the <code>faces</code> and <code>vertices</code> structures that you have just looked at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will return to the matlab file to run <strong>section D</strong>  to view the GIFTI metadata in a browser to see exactly how the XML is used to represent the GIFTI format. If you don't have firefox installed on your machine then replace <code>firefox</code> with  the name of your installed browser.  You will need to have the browser on your path. If it is not then replace <code>firefox</code> with the full path e.g. <code>/usr/bin/firefox</code></p>
<pre><code>system('firefox mygifti_allxml.gii')
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you don't have the browser on your path you will get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>'firefox' is not recognized as an internal or external command. operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can simply open the <code>mygifti_allxml.gii</code> file directly in your browser and ignore trying to run it in matlab as indicated above if this proves tricky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can collapse and expand XML sections in the browser by clicking on the -/+ signs respectively. Notice that the vertex anatomical location information is represented as a <strong>DataArray</strong> with an <strong>Intent</strong> name of <code>NIFTI_INTENT_POINTSET</code>. The number of vertices is captured by <strong>Dim0="130879"</strong>. The triangular faces are represented in the second data array.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_optionalD.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the <strong>Data</strong> tag in the <code>NIFTI_INTENT_POINTSET</code> dataarray and then look at the surface mesh vertex information that is loaded in by the gifti library. Notice how the columns are loaded in first before the rows. This is known as Column Major Order and is specified also in the XML as a DataArray attribute as <code>&lt;DataArray ArrayIndexingOrder="ColumnMajorOrder"..</code>  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_optionalD_col.png" />
<img alt="select all vertices" src="../../img/task2_optionalD_colmat.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notice also that for the faces defined as <code>NIFTI_INTENT_TRIANGLE</code> in the second DataArray that the vertices are indexed starting from zero and are also stored using Column Major Order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Section E</strong> accomplishes the same as Section D except that now the xml data is loaded into a matlab structure. You can skip this section as all it does is corroborate what you have already seen above. It is divided into 2 parts, <strong>E1</strong> and <strong>E2</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Section <strong>E1</strong> to fix the xml in the GIFTI. We need to do this as unfortunately there is a slight problem reading the XML file into matlab as the 2nd line which starts <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE</code> causes problems with the parser. The line <code>sed 2d...</code> in the matlab file is written to delete this line on unix and save a new text file called <code>mygifti_xml.gii</code> which is then parsed. In windows you will need to comment out this line and use <code>powershell</code> if its available or alternatively manually open the xml file in a text processor and delete the 2nd line. In matlab you can invoke a powershell shell as follows:</p>
<pre><code>!powershell
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After powershell loads enter the command below to remove the 2nd line:</p>
<pre><code>    Get-Content mygifti_allxml.gii  | Where {$_ -notmatch 'DOCTYPE'} | Set-Content mygifti_xml.gii
</code></pre>
<p>Then return to matlab by typing <code>exit</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now run <strong>Section E2</strong> to load the XML into a matlab structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now identify the same XML structures as we saw above in the browser. For example <code>myXML.GIFTI.DataArray{2}.Data</code> gives us the <strong>faces</strong> information for the surface:</p>
<pre><code>myXML.GIFTI.DataArray{2}.Data
    =
Text: '0 3 0 56 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 72 3 3 4 4 6 14 6 6 6 11
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-3-use-matlab-to-manipulate-and-visualize-gifti-overlays">Task 3: Use Matlab to manipulate and visualize GIFTI overlays</h2>
<p>We have been able to work with and manipulate <strong>GIFTI surface files</strong>. In this task we will now look at an example of a <strong>GIFTI overlay</strong> that maps cortical thickness  values onto the pial vertices and we will attempt to manipulate and visualize this overlay.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>wb_view</strong> is already open from previous tasks then you can use the <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Save/Manage Files</code> functionality to selectively close files. Select to close the Right Pial and the amended Left pial. We will be using the original Left pial in this task.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task2_closeselect.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively if you want to start from scracth then just choose <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Close all files</code> </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_closefiles.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>in <strong>wb_view</strong> load in the surface <code>100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> again from <code>Practicum81/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/</code> if not already open. Click on <strong>Surface</strong> to view the Left hemisphere. Now load in the cortical thickness overlay <code>100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> from the same location. You will need to change the <code>Files of type</code> field to  <code>Metric Files (*.func.gii *.shape.gii)</code> or <code>Any File (*)</code> to be able to select the thickness overlay. Activate the layer by clicking on the checkbox alongside it. Also click on the color bar to see the range of cortical thicknesses across the brain and their associated colors.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task3_loadOverlay.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now locate the vertices you looked at previously (using <code>Window</code> &gt; <code>identify</code>) and find their cortical thicknesses by looking at the information dialog. Notice that for our central vertex (119115 in this case)  we have a cortical thickness of 3.54125 mm.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task3_viewThickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will now open this overlay in Matlab, change the cortical thickness of our target vertex and its neighbors and visualize the changed overlay in wb_view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the file <code>task_003_giftioverlay.m</code> in matlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As before run each section in matlab separately to follow along with what is happening in the code. First run the <code>addpath ..</code> section to ensure that the gifti library is accessible and that all Matlab windows are closed and variables cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In  section <strong>A</strong> we load in the surface as before and now also load in the cortical thickness overlay. Notice that the overlay and the surface match as the number of vertices is equal to the number of thickness values.</p>
<pre><code>Reading Surface ./DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Native/100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overlay has all its thickness values for each vertex stored in a <code>cdata</code> matrix:</p>
<pre><code>myoverlayleft =

  struct with fields:

    cdata: [130879×1 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the gifti library's overloaded <code>plot</code> command we also visualize the surface in one window and also observe overlay plotted on the surface in another window with a color scale used to designate varying thickness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task3_overlaymesh.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Section B</strong> we see a print out of the cortical thickness values at our neighbouring vertices which should match the values we identifed in <strong>wb_view</strong>. In <strong>Section C</strong> we set all the thicknesses to a uniform value of 2mm and then save a copy called 
<code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to wb_view and open the <code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> overlay. Compare this with the original  <code>100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> overlay and confirm that all the vertices now have a thickness value of 2mm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task3_changeThickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can change what overlays are activated and the precedence in which they are displayed by selecting different files and/or toggling the visibility of the layer. You may also want to change the <code>Drawing Type</code> in <code>Surface</code> &gt; <code>Properties</code> to <code>Triangles</code> to see a clear thickness change in the patch of cortex as you toggle between layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task3_layerprec.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition you may also want to view the amended cortical thickness overlay <code>amended.100307.L.thickness.native.shape.gii</code> on your amended pial surface <code>amended.100307.L.pial.native.surf.gii</code> or on other surfaces that are available in the same directory. These surfaces are all in vertex correspondence for the subject 100307.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section D and E you can again study the XML structure of the overlay to see how it corresponds to the gifti structure loaded into matlab.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-4-use-matlab-to-manipulate-and-visualize-cifti-files">Task 4: Use Matlab to manipulate and visualize CIFTI files</h2>
<p>So far we have learned to work with GIFTI files. In this last task we are going to work with CIFTI files which combine both volume data for subcortical structures and surface data for cortical structures. Unfortunately the HCP's matlab library is still in <a href="https://github.com/Washington-University/cifti-matlab">Alpha testing</a> and so we need to be aware that there is a slight chance that the coding conventions used here may change however the overal conceptual approach should remain the same.</p>
<p>We will work with HCP data again and this time with CIFTI cortical thickness data <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> from the left and right cortex. </p>
<p>To visualize CIFTI data in <code>wb_view</code> we need a GIFTI surface file that is associated with the CIFTI data. Close all loaded surfaces and overlays if <code>wb_view</code> is already open.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <code>wb_view</code> and load in GIFTI surface <code>100307.L.midthickness.native.surf.gii</code> - this surface is midway between the <code>pial</code> surface we used previously and the <code>white</code> surface. Now load in the midthickness surface for the right hemisphere <code>100307.R.midthickness.native.surf.gii</code>. Click on <strong>All</strong> view to see both hemispheres aligned in the view. You can rotate the whole brain to a perspective that works for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_alignedsurface.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now open <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> - you will need to specify <strong>Files of type: (*.dscalar.nii)</strong> to be able to select this file. Activate the layer by clicking on the checkbox and notice that this CIFTI file has cortical thickness information for both hemispheres. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_ciftithickness.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lets return to matlab and open the matlab file <code>task004_cifti.m</code> and execute the prelim section to load in the matlab libraries that we need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Section A</strong> we will briefly explore the overlay <code>100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> as a NIFTI-2 file. We will use a private function  <code>read_nifti2_hdr.m</code> which is packaged as part of the <code>FieldTrip</code> Matlab library. The diagram below shows how a NIFTI-2 file is used to package up this CIFTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/Cifti_format.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can confirm that the size of the CIFTI file in bytes is equal to the size of the voxel offset field plus the data size in bytes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; filesize = 
     2525056

&gt;&gt; nii2.vox_offset
   1531104

&gt;&gt; nii2.dim
   6   1  1  1  1  1  248488  1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>where the value of <code>nii2.dim[7] = 248488</code> is the data size in floats which is equal to <code>4*248488=993952</code> in bytes. The XML is thus embedded in the extent section between the header and the data. It is this section that the cifti-matlab library reads to determine exactly how the surface and volume models are set up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>Section B</strong> to explore the CIFTI XML file in a matlab structure and in a browser. Notice that like the gifti overlay this cifti overlay has data for both cortices in a <code>cdata</code> structure which can be accessed as <code>ciiall.cdata</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ciiall

ciiall =

  struct with fields:

    metadata: [1×3 struct]
     diminfo: {[1×1 struct]  [1×1 struct]}
       cdata: [248488×1 single]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The xml data has also been stored in a CIFTI structure</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ciixml

ciixml =

  struct with fields:

    CIFTI: [1×1 struct]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information stored in the above two structures matches the XML data that can be visualized in the browser. Notice that the first dimension is <code>CIFTI_INDEX_TYPE_SCALARS</code> which means that each vertex/voxel has a single scalar value which in this file is the cortical thickness. Also notice that the second dimenions is <code>CIFTI_INDEX_TYPE_BRAIN_MODELS</code> which is used to map every voxel/vertex in a cortical or subcortical structure. Just the  left cortex <code>CIFTI_STRUCTURE_CORTEX_LEFT</code> and the right cortex <code>CIFTI_STRUCTURE_CORTEX_RIGHT</code> are represented in this file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_ciftixmlscalar.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information for each cortex can be obtained by looking at the <code>diminfo</code> fields. Here we look at the model for the CORTEX_LEFT which is contained in <code>diminfo{1}.models{1}</code></p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{1}

 ans =

   struct with fields:

        start: 1
        count: 125197
       struct: 'CORTEX_LEFT'
         type: 'surf'
      numvert: 130879
     vertlist: [1×125197 double]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike the GIFTI matlab library that indexed vertices starting from 1, this CIFTI library uses an index to index the vertices! This is a little complicated but in essence if we look at the <code>vertlist</code> structure for the first three vertices in the left hemisphere we see that they are correctly identified as 0,1 and 2.</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{1}.vertlist(1:3)
ans =

     0     1     2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>As already mentioned, the data structure <code>ciiall</code> contains all the cortical thickness data for both hemispheres in <code>ciiall.cdata</code> indexed starting from 1 to 125197 for the left cortex and from 125198 to 248488. These indexes are used as pointers into a vertex list <code>vertlist</code> which is stored for each surface. So the cortical thickness values for the first three vertices 0,1,2 in the Left hemisphere are obtained as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.cdata(1:3)

ans =

  3×1 single column vector

        2.201649
        2.323979
         2.41378
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>There however appears to be an inconsistency with the total number of vertices allocated to the overlay. In the last task we had 130879 vertices in the left hemisphere but here we have 125197 vertices assigned (roughly about 5600 vertices fewer). What's going on? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essentially the HCP CIFTI files do not store data for the medial layer of each cortex. We saw the medial layer in the first task. We will identify these medial vertices and visualize a few of them on the left cortex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <strong>section C</strong> to print out all the vertices that are missing from the left cortex. These are the medial vertices. There should be <code>5682</code> vertices in the medial layer displayed to screen. Select one or a few of them and using the <code>identify</code> tool in <code>wb_view</code> try to see where they are. You will need to use the surface view and visualize the left cortex only so you can see these vertices. Some of these are easier to spot than others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_mediallayer.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>section D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> we do what we did in task 3 and will now go ahead and change the value of a vertex and its neighbors to a constant value of 2mm cortical thickness. The code uses a vertex value of 119115 but of course you should use any vertex you like except for the medial vertices which the CIFTI file does not track. Open the <code>amended.100307.thickness.native.dscalar.nii</code> that is created in your current directory in wb_view and navigate to the vertex to confirm that changes have been made.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_changethickness.png" /></p>
<h2 id="task-5-use-matlab-to-manipulate-and-visualize-cifti-files-with-volumes-and-surfaces-combined">Task 5: Use Matlab to manipulate and visualize CIFTI files with volumes and surfaces combined</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now look at a slightly more complex CIFTI file which stores fMRI data for Surface and Volume structures simultanesously. We will be working in the HCP's standard space for this and so will close all the files in wb_view and then load in the surfaces which we will be using for this exploration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Open File</code> and navigate to <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/fsaverage_LR32k/</code> and open the surfaces <code>100307.R.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code> and <code>100307.L.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select the <strong>All</strong> view and then load in the fMRI <code>dtseries.nii</code> CIFTI file <code>rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> from the location <code>DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/Results/rfMRI_REST1_LR/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the file overlay from <code>dynconn - rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dynconn</code> to the dtseries <code>rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> and switch on the overlay to see the first time points of the resting state fMRI series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotate the brain. Notice that their are values in both the cortex and in free floating voxels which represent the subcortex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.ni
<img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_ciftifmri.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>To navigate the volume data more conveniently you can click on the <strong>Volume</strong> view to access the traditional volume viewing interface. Again you will need to switch on the overlay and choose <code>rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> over the <code>dynconn...</code> overlay. You can move through volume slices by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. You can zoom in by using the mouse scroll wheel. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_ciftivolume.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>To help with spatial awareness you can load in a NIFTI-1 T1w volume. Open <code>T1w_restore_brain.nii.gz</code> which is available at <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task5_volume.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In both the voxel and surface view individual fmri instances at each TR can be viewed by clicking on the <strong>map</strong> drop down and selecting the time instance of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_changetime.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One nice application within <code>wb_view</code> is the ability to interactively view functional connectivity. To see this in action Let us activate the <strong>All</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can then load in Freesurfer's Destrieux atlas which has been converted to gifti format. The left and right hemisphere atlases are called <code>100307.L.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code> and <code>100307.R.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code> and are available here <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/fsaverage_LR32k/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activate  all three overlays in the <strong>All</strong> view and from top to bottom select the <code>Dynconn - rfMRI..</code> layer, then the Left and Right atlas label files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now click on any brain area and you will see the functional connectivity of every other vertex to that vertex which has been calculated dynamically. If you spin the cortex around you will also see that the connectivity is also calculated for voxels as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_dynconn.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For the above we used a different color map which is accessible from the little spanner symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_changecolors.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Back to <code>matlab</code> now so we can explore a little more how this CIFTI file stores both volumes and surfaces in the same NIFTI-2 file. Open <code>task_005_cifti.m</code> and run the first section as usual to clear the workspace and add the necessary libraries to our path. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Section <strong>A</strong> to se how the CIFTI XML has different sections forsurfaces and for voxels. Note that each volume struture has an individual label e.g CIFTI_STRUCTURE_ACCUMBENS_LEFT </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>B</strong>, we will now take an arbitrary vertex 17617 in the <strong>Right</strong> hemisphere and plot the fmri data in that vertex along with its closest neighbors. Observe that we have to check for existence of the neighbors that we find in the available list of vertices because one of the neighbors might actually be in the medial layer. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is achieved using the code below which takes <code>allverts</code> which includes vertex 17617 as well as its close neighbours and compares it against all the visible vertices that are not on the medial layer.</p>
<pre><code>neighindex=ismember(visverts,allverts);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice also how we have to pinpoint the Right Hemisphere vertex data within <code>ciiall.cdata</code> data by using an offset because the <code>ciiall.cdata</code> is populated first with values from the left cortex but the Right Hemisphere starts indexing its vertices from 0. </p>
<pre><code>findRHneighbors=findneighbors + ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{2}.start - 1
..
plot(ciiall.cdata(findRHneighbors,:)')
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_timeseries.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>C</strong>, we do the same for another arbitrary point on the Right cortex, vertex 8470 and we see a plot of the time series for this vertex and its neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In section <strong>D</strong>, we now switch gears and look at a volume. We will investigate the Left Hippocampus which is indexed as model number 14 in the array of available models. Volumes are indexed using a voxel list <code>voxlist</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ciiall.diminfo{1}.models{14} =

<p>We will now use an arbitrary voxel 56,56,25 within the Left Hippocampus and identify its potential neighbors. We allow diagonal voxel elements to be classified as neighbors and so a voxel can have potentially 26 close neighbors. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again as with the vertices we check the <code>voxlist</code> for existence as some of these voxels might be in other structures and thus not accessible within the Left Hippocampus. We do find that there are 26 neighbors to our voxel. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Section <strong>E</strong> we simulate an fMRI signal and place identical copies of it in vertex 17617 and its 6 neighbors, vertex 8470 and its 6 neighbours and voxel 56,56,25 and its 26 neighbors. And finally in section <strong>F</strong> we save a copy of this ata in a new CIFTI file called <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let's return to <strong>wb_view</strong>. It might be easier to close all files and then load in the following files:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/fsaverage_LR32k/</code> load in the following:
<code>100307.R.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code>,
<code>100307.L.aparc.a2009s.32k_fs_LR.label.gii</code>,
<code>100307.R.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code> and 
<code>100307.L.midthickness.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <code>/DATA/HCP/100307/MNINonLinear/</code> load in the following:
<code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> and 
<code>T1w_restore_brain.nii.gz</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally we can now load in the amended fMRI from the current directory <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Volume</strong> view and activate the <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> layer. In the <strong>Slice Indices/Coords</strong> section enter in the voxel coordinates of the left hippocampal voxel <code>56,56,25</code>. The cross-hairs should center on that voxel. Zoom in to the voxel by using the mouse scroll wheel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_hippovox1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now activate the <code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> layer and click on the crosshairs to confirm voxel <code>56,56,25</code> is in the Left Hippocampus. Also notice that the voxels around it have the same value as we would expect. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_hippovox2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivate the <code>aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz</code> layer and now change the <code>amended.rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dtseries.nii</code> layer. to <code>dynconn - rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dynconn</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_hippodyncon.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Now change the view to <strong>Surface</strong>, deactivate the Left cortex and rotate the brain to view the Right hemisphere  and activate the <code>dynconn - rfMRI_REST1_LR_Atlas_hp2000_clean.dynconn</code> layer. You should be able to identify that the vertices 8470 and 17617 are functionally connected to the hippocampus. This is what we expect as we placed identical fmri values in all these three regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_surfdynconn.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to experiment with different color palette settings and/or views to get a more dramatic effect. Shown below is the <code>magma</code> color palette with a range defined from <code>0.2</code> to <code>-0.2</code> used in the <strong>All</strong> view with the voxel settings set at <code>56,56,25</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_colorpalette.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the right hemisphere outside of vertices 8470 or 17617 will reduce the functional connectivity of the hippocampal voxels. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_nosurfdynconn_magma.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>And clicking on those vertices will re-establish the functional connectivity with the hippocampus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="select surfaces" src="../../img/task4_surfdynconn_magma.png" /></p>

<p>This concludes this introduction to the GIFTI and CIFTI formats. This practicum has used Matlab libraries to query, read and write Surface-Based formats however there are other approaches like the Python-based NiBabel library which provides functions for working with <a href="https://nipy.org/nibabel/reference/nibabel.cifti2.html">Cifti</a> and <a href="https://nipy.org/nibabel/reference/nibabel.gifti.html">Gifti</a> files. </p>
<p>To gain more experience using <strong>wb_view</strong> then material from from the <a href="https://wustl.app.box.com/s/baq0i7xeqe9qblzfyrd3xo6ifawv8j58">HCP 2018 Course</a> and the  <a href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/tutorials/Connectome_WB_Tutorial_v1.0.pdf">HCP's Connectome Workbench v1.0 Tutorial</a> might be useful.</p>
